Useful Apple Scripts to Automate the Boring Stuff

I recommend using these along with a cronjob or bash script. 
If you want to run any script just use.

`osascript ~/path/to/script.scpt <parameter>`

You can plug that straight into your bash script and run whatever apple script you want. 

Available scripts: 

`send-late-text.scpt her-number message`
  - Sends a text to her-number with contents of message. 
  - You'll need iMessage for this to work.
