Useful Apple Scripts to Automate the Boring Stuff

I recommend using these along with a cronjob or bash script. 
If you want to run any script just use.

`osascript ~/path/to/script.scpt <parameter>`

You can plug that straight into your bash script and run whatever apple script you want. 

Available scripts: 

send-late-text.scpt <her number> <message>
  - Got this one from the legendary hacker-scripts repo and modified it to meed my much less aggressive needs.
